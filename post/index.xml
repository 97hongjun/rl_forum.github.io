Abstract  Reinforcement learning agents have demonstrated remarkable achievements in simulated environments. Data efficiency poses an impediment to carrying this success over to real environments. The design of data-efficient agents calls for a deeper understanding of information acquisition and representation. We develop concepts and establish a regret bound that together offer principled guidance. The bound sheds light on questions of what information to seek, how to seek that information, and what information to retain.</description>

Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Statistics,
Stanford
Abstract  Deep model-based reinforcement learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art sample efficiency but we lack a theoretical understanding of them. This talk will first show that convergence to a global maximum requires an exponential number of samples even for a one-layer neural net bandit problem, which is strictly easier than RL. Therefore, we propose to study convergence to local maxima.</description>

      <description>Presenter  Kuang Xu
Associate Professor of Operations, Information and Technology,
Stanford Graduate School of Business
Abstract  I will discuss in this talk a new diffusion-asymptotic analysis for sequentially randomized experiments. Rather than taking sample size n to infinity while keeping the problem parameters fixed, we let the mean signal level scale to the order 1/\sqrt{n} so as to preserve the difficulty of the learning task as n gets large.</description>

      <description>Presenter  Tor Lattimore
Research Scientist,
Deepmind, London
Abstract  Tor will give a whirlwind tour of a series of recent papers on the information directed sampling algorithm for sequential decision-making. The results come in three flavours. First, generalising and applying the IDS algorithm to problems with a rich information structure such as convex bandits and partial monitoring. Second, showing a connection between the optimisation problem solved by IDS and the optimisation problem that determines the asymptotic lower bound for stochastic structured bandit problems.</description>
