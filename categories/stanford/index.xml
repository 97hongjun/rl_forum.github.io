Abstract  Deep model-based reinforcement learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art sample efficiency but we lack a theoretical understanding of them. This talk will first show that convergence to a global maximum requires an exponential number of samples even for a one-layer neural net bandit problem, which is strictly easier than RL. Therefore, we propose to study convergence to local maxima.</description>

Abstract  I will discuss in this talk a new diffusion-asymptotic analysis for sequentially randomized experiments. Rather than taking sample size n to infinity while keeping the problem parameters fixed, we let the mean signal level scale to the order 1/\sqrt{n} so as to preserve the difficulty of the learning task as n gets large.</description>
