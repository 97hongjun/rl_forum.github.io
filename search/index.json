[{"content":"Presenter  Xiuyuan (Lucy) Lu\nResearch Scientist,\nDeepMind, Mountain View\nAbstract  Reinforcement learning agents have demonstrated remarkable achievements in simulated environments. Data efficiency poses an impediment to carrying this success over to real environments. The design of data-efficient agents calls for a deeper understanding of information acquisition and representation. We develop concepts and establish a regret bound that together offer principled guidance. The bound sheds light on questions of what information to seek, how to seek that information, and what information to retain. To illustrate concepts, we design simple agents that build on them and present computational results that demonstrate improvements in data efficiency.

This talk will first show that convergence to a global maximum requires an exponential number of samples even for a one-layer neural net bandit problem, which is strictly easier than RL. Therefore, we propose to study convergence to local maxima. For both nonlinear bandit and RL, I will present a model-based algorithm, Virtual Ascent with Online Model Learner (ViOL), which provably converges to a local maximum with sample complexity that only depends on the sequential Rademacher complexity of the model class. Our results imply novel global or local regret bounds on several concrete settings such as linear bandit with finite or sparse model class, and two-layer neural net bandit.

Rather than taking sample size n to infinity while keeping the problem parameters fixed, we let the mean signal level scale to the order 1/\\sqrt{n} so as to preserve the difficulty of the learning task as n gets large. In this regime, we show that the behavior of a class of methods for sequential experimentation converges to a diffusion limit. This connection enables us to make sharp performance predictions and obtain new insights on the behavior of Thompson sampling. Our diffusion asymptotics also help resolve a discrepancy between the Θ(log(n)) regret predicted by the fixed-parameter, large-sample asymptotics on the one hand, and the Θ(\\sqrt{n}) regret from worst-case, finite-sample analysis on the other, suggesting that it is an appropriate asymptotic regime for understanding practical large-scale sequential experiments.

The results come in three flavours. First, generalising and applying the IDS algorithm to problems with a rich information structure such as convex bandits and partial monitoring. Second, showing a connection between the optimisation problem solved by IDS and the optimisation problem that determines the asymptotic lower bound for stochastic structured bandit problems. Third, showing a deep connection between IDS and the mirror descent framework for convex optimisation.
